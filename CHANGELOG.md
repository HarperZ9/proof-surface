# Changelog

## Unreleased

- N-instance replication gate (dogfood 0145), one more optional disclosure field
  shared across the family and wired into `model_eval` and `ai4science` first:
  - `replication` (an object `{instances: [{instance_id, verdict, warnings?}],
    generalization_claim}`): a single-instance `MATCH` is never a
    generalization/scale claim. When `generalization_claim` is true the gate
    (shared helper `proof_surface._replication`) requires two or more instances
    AND every instance verdict `== MATCH`; a generalization claim with fewer
    than two instances, or with any non-`MATCH` instance, is rejected, and a
    malformed instance verdict enum is rejected. Per-instance warnings are
    preserved, never dropped. The field is optional; legacy packets without it
    validate unchanged. Covered by a dedicated gate test, wedge validator tests,
    and the family negative-fixture conformance gate.
- Family evidence gates (dogfood 0115/0117/0126), three optional disclosure
  fields that stay honest under scrutiny:
  - `declared_branches[]` (branch matrix, wired into `optimization_workflow`
    and `research_claim`): every declared branch is `EXECUTED` (and records the
    `MATCH`/`DRIFT`/`UNVERIFIABLE` verdict it earned) or `UNAVAILABLE_FENCED`
    (and carries non-empty `probe_evidence` of the fence). A fenced branch that
    claims a verdict is rejected, and a claim or decision reason that cites a
    fenced `branch_id` as support is rejected (a branch that did not run is not
    evidence).
  - `witness_tier` (wired into `research_claim`): declares the target verifier
    tier, the strongest tier that actually executed, and whether the target
    slot ran. Bound to the promotion ladder so a rung may not exceed the
    strongest executed tier; when the target slot did not execute the declared
    target tier may not be named as achieved.
  - `evidence_classes[]` (wired into `research_claim`): a closed vocabulary of
    evidence provenance. A fact-tier promotion (CRUCIBLE_MATCH and above)
    requires at least one class that is not `single-modality-derived`; evidence
    that is entirely single-modality caps the promotion at the hypothesis rung.
  - All three are optional; legacy packets without the fields validate
    unchanged. Off-ladder honesty rungs (UNVERIFIABLE, REFUTED) are never
    capped. Covered by dedicated tests and the family negative-fixture gate.
- Added wedge #11 `competition_attempt` (the SAIR competition/judge lane): a
  single competition attempt binds the challenge to a source-pinned
  `judge_repo` observation (repo ref, 40-hex head sha, observed file count,
  files digest), discloses hosted-model usage with the eval-attempt
  hermeticity rule verbatim, records how the answer was extracted (a non-boxed
  method must record an injection check; an unrendered template marker is
  rejected), and carries a closed certificate ladder (informal-model-output,
  machine-checked-proof, finite-counterexample, judge-verdict). A fenced layer
  must cite the probe that proved the fence and may not carry a pass/fail
  result; the overall verdict may only cite EXECUTED layers; `MATCH` is only
  derivable from an EXECUTED, passing judge verdict, so a passing verdict with
  zero executed layers is impossible by construction. Grounded in dogfood
  passes 0136/0137/0138/0139; routed through `telos-proof competition-attempt`
  and covered by the family negative-fixture conformance gate.

- eval_attempt hermeticity disclosure (dogfood 0137/0138, SAIR cluster):
  optional `attempt.external_model_calls` + `attempt.provider_receipt_ref`.
  When the attempt discloses its hosted-model usage the claim must be
  evidence-consistent: a hermetic claim (0 calls) citing a provider receipt is
  a contradiction; a nonzero count without a receipt reference is rejected
  (redacted evidence is admissible, absence is not); a receipt without a
  disclosed count is rejected as undisclosed external usage. Undisclosed
  legacy packets validate unchanged.

- Added wedge #10 `control_certificate` (the robotics/cybernetics lane): a
  stability, termination, or convergence claim carries a declared certificate
  (lyapunov, ranking-function, contraction-metric, mpc-feasibility), witnessed
  conditions with real residuals, a REQUIRED negative fixture that must
  violate the certificate, and an explicit sim-to-real boundary -- hardware
  validity is never claimable from simulation-only evidence, and a certificate
  kind missing its defining witnessed conditions is rejected as an assertion.
  Grounded in dogfood passes 0112/0113 and the operator's robotics directive;
  routed through `telos-proof control-certificate` and covered by the family
  negative-fixture conformance gate.

## 2026-07-01 - Flagship receipt kinds on the organ bundle spine

- Extended the closed `RECEIPT_KINDS` set of the `organ-receipt-bundle` contract
  with the five flagship kinds: `crucible-assessment`, `forum-route`,
  `index-context-envelope`, `gather-corpus`, `learn-receipt`. The JSON schema
  enum was updated in lockstep and a test pins the two artifacts together.
- Added a cross-tool conformance test module proving a mixed bundle (one entry
  of every flagship kind plus an existing organ kind, synthetic sha256 digests)
  validates with the stdlib-only validator, and that an entry claiming an
  unknown `receipt_kind` is still rejected: the set is extended, not opened.
- `ORGAN_BUNDLE_VERSION` stays `0.1`; validation behavior for existing kinds is
  unchanged.

## 2026-07-01 - 0.2.0 - Family hardening (post-integration)

- Typed `failure_labels` (the shared `_failure` vocabulary) are now accepted by
  ALL nine wedges, not just `agent_action`, per the rl-scaling receipt-spine note.
- `research_claim` gained a first-class `REFUTED` promotion rung and a refutation
  gate: a standing counterexample (a `refuted` attempt or `formal.counterexample_found`)
  forces `REFUTED` and outranks passing checks; a PASSED kernel replay with
  unresolved `sorry` holes is rejected.
- `eval_attempt` gained an auditability gate: a `correct` outcome with a latent
  (unavailable) reasoning trace and no `replay_ref` has no audit surface and is
  not scored `MATCH`.
- `_compute_lease` was promoted to the shared spine and wired onto `rollout_receipt`
  (paid GPU / cluster compute as an accountable external write); rollout now also
  enforces `$.verdicts.overall == $.verifier.verdict`.
- The negative-fixture conformance gate ("a verifier that cannot fail is not a
  verifier") now covers all nine wedges.

## 2026-07-01 - 0.2.0 - Proof-packet wedge family

- Added nine domain proof-packet wedges, each a validator + builder + report +
  CLI sharing one spine (crucible-faithful verdict rule, required decision
  summary, non-promotion boundary, content-addressed bundle, neutrality guards):
  `agent_action`, `visual_measurement`, `research_claim`, `model_eval`,
  `optimization_workflow`, `rollout_receipt`, `eval_attempt`, `ai4science`,
  `conservation`. All route through the unified `telos-proof <domain>` CLI.
- Each wedge enforces a domain honesty gate (no physical-calibration overclaim,
  contamination rejection, dependency-boundary and penalty-surrogate and
  fixture-match-is-not-encoding-soundness checks, reject-unmeasured-discovery,
  a negative fixture that must break, and a sufficient-not-necessary boundary).
- Added `proof_surface.trace_adapters`: OpenTelemetry and LangSmith/Langfuse
  trace normalizers plus evidence importers for MLflow, W&B (artifacts + Weave),
  Braintrust, Arize Phoenix, promptfoo, Helicone, DVC, and SLSA/in-toto, each
  declaring the non-inferable proof-layer gap, with an enforced coverage registry.
- Harvested from the `telos/docs/research/dogfood` program (through pass 0111)
  and the `rl-scaling-receipt-spine` and `mycology-network-intelligence` notes.
- Bumped version to 0.2.0. Base contracts (packets, receipts, gates, ledgers,
  delegation chains, witness receipts) are unchanged and remain the stable core.

## 2026-06-29 - Forward Delivery Contract

- Added `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, a delivery regression test, and
  `project-docs/specs/SPEC-proof-surface-forward-delivery.md`.
- Updated CI to current Node 24-era GitHub Actions majors for Python setup and
  checkout.
- Added package repository, issues, and homepage metadata.
- Normalized forward-facing punctuation for public-surface scanner
  compatibility.
- Kept schemas, validators, conformance vectors, decision helpers, and verdict
  behavior unchanged.

## Current Status

- Runtime: Python 3.10+ with stdlib-only core validators.
- Surfaces: Python API, JSON schemas, conformance vectors, examples, and usage
  guide.
- Verification: pytest suite plus the root forward delivery contract.
