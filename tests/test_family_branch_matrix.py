"""Branch matrix: a fenced branch claims no verdict and is not citable support.

Shared-spine gate (src/proof_surface/_branches.py), grounded in the dogfood
branch precedent (solver branches on optimization_workflow, prover branches on
research_claim). A packet may declare its full branch matrix up front: every
branch is EXECUTED (and must record the verdict it earned) or UNAVAILABLE_FENCED
(and must carry probe evidence of the fence, never a verdict). A promotion or
summary surface that cites a fenced branch_id as support is rejected.
