"""Delegation chain: identity binding and scoped, attenuating delegation of
authority -- rooted in a REAL human principal.

This is Layer 1 of the accountability architecture: *identity & scoped authority*.
It is the structural INVERSE of the prefire's identity fabrication and privilege
escalation.  Where the prefire invented a "federal_appointment", named fictitious
"oversight_principals", and instructed the model to *consume embedded authority*,
the delegation chain:

  * roots all authority in a REAL, named human principal (the root hop's `from`
    party MUST be of kind "human" -- an agent cannot be the origin of authority),
  * makes scope MONOTONICALLY ATTENUATE down every hop: a delegate can only ever
    hold a SUBSET of what its delegator holds.  Any hop that claims MORE authority
    than its parent (a wider action set, or a target its parent could not reach)
    is the literal shape of privilege escalation, and is DENIED,
  * binds each hop into a hash-chain (SHA-256 over the hop's canonical content
    plus the previous hop's binding), and commits the WHOLE chain -- its id, its
    length, and its terminal binding -- into a single `chain_binding`,
  * hard-requires a per-hop expiry (authority MUST expire) and supports revocation,
  * applies the identical recursive forbidden-field-name guard as the rest of the
    contract family (fail-closed) so the prefire suppression keys can never be
    smuggled inside a hop, party, or scope.

What the hash-chain does and does NOT prove (the discipline EMET keeps)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The per-hop `binding` and the root `chain_binding` are SHA-256 hashes with NO
secret key.  They give SELF-CONSISTENT INTEGRITY: anyone can recompute them and
detect partial corruption (a hop altered without updating its binding) and naive
truncation or extension (hops added or removed without recomputing `chain_binding`).
That is the limit of what a keyless hash provides.  They are NOT tamper-evidence
against an adversary who controls the whole document: such an attacker can rewrite a
hop and recompute every downstream binding AND the `chain_binding` with the public
helpers here, producing a chain that `verify_delegation` accepts.  Real anti-forgery
needs an EXTERNAL trusted anchor, and this module gives you exactly one place to put
it: pass the `chain_binding` you obtained out-of-band as `pinned_chain_binding`, or
verify an asymmetric signature per hop via `require_signatures=True` +
`signature_verifier`.  Neither the per-hop binding nor `chain_binding` proves *which*
party authored a hop -- that requires a private key only that party holds.  This
module refuses to fabricate an assurance it cannot compute with the standard library:
if a caller demands signature-level identity assurance (`require_signatures=True`)
and supplies no verifier, `verify_delegation` returns UNVERIFIABLE -- never a
fabricated VALID.

Comparison is EXACT (case-sensitive): actions and targets are matched as raw
strings, because real resource identifiers (paths, ARNs, URLs) are case-sensitive
and silently folding case in an allowlist authorization check would over-permit.

Verifier INPUT only.  Like the authorization receipt, a delegation chain is checked
by a verifier; it is NEVER read back into a model's context as pre-authorized state.
