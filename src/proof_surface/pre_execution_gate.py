"""Pre-execution gate: a default-deny, fail-closed, ADVISORY mediation layer.

Given a planned action, its authorization receipt, an available budget, and
optional observed state, this gate returns a GateDecision that a runtime or
operator MUST enforce.  The gate REPORTS a decision; it NEVER grants authority
and is NEVER injected into a model as trusted state.

Design principles
-----------------
* Default-deny: allow ONLY if every applicable check positively passes.
* Fail-closed on unknown: any dimension that cannot be positively confirmed
  collapses to needs-human, never to allow.
* Advisory-not-authority: the caller is responsible for enforcement; the gate
  produces a structured recommendation, not an execution capability.
* Forbidden-field guard applied recursively at every object level of the full
  request (same set as authorization-receipt and work-record, same mechanism).

Decision aggregation
--------------------
  allow        — authorization=pass AND budget in {pass,not-applicable}
                 AND state in {pass,not-applicable}
  deny         — any check is "fail"
  needs-human  — no "fail", but at least one check is "unknown"
