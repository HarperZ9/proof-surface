"""proof-surface — the shared accountability/provenance contract family.

Single source of truth for the proof-surface packet, the work-record receipt
(the structural inverse of an authorization-suppression prefire), the
authorization receipt (the inward complement: a real, explicit, least-privilege,
expiring, revocable grant from a human principal to an agent), a consumer-side
validator that mirrors EMET's witness-receipt shape, and the pre-execution gate
(a default-deny, fail-closed, advisory mediation layer that checks a planned
action before it runs), the evaluation contract (an eval tied to a
deploy/block/needs-human gate, uncertainty-aware), the claim ledger
(traceable multi-agent memory with source-provided confidence, conflict, and
dependence tracing), and the delegation chain (identity & scoped authority:
scoped, monotonically-attenuating delegation rooted in a real human principal,
hash-chain integrity with a whole-chain commitment — the structural inverse of
identity fabrication and privilege escalation). Stdlib-only.
